** #Key Analysis Questions:

1) How does active video game play influence physical activity in children?
2) Do sedentary video games negatively affect physical activity?
3) What role do demographic factors (e.g., gender, age) play in activity levels?
4) How do parental behaviors influence children's physical activity?
5) How did children’s motivation for physical activity change over time?
6) Did motivation for active video games correlate with increased physical activity?


** #Conclusion:

Positive Impact of Active Video Games: The intervention led to an increase in physical activity among children, especially during the 6-week period.
Sustained Activity Levels: While activity decreased post-washout, some children maintained higher levels compared to baseline.
Motivation Matters: Children with higher motivation for active games were more likely to increase their physical activity.


** #Recommendations:

Encourage Active Video Game Play: Schools and parents should consider integrating active video games as part of regular physical activity routines for sedentary children.
Sustain Activity Post-Intervention: Future programs should include follow-up activities or continuous engagement to prevent drop-offs in physical activity after interventions.
Parental Engagement: Educate parents on the importance of their role in supporting children’s physical activity to maximize the impact of such interventions.
